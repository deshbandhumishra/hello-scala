@Sai â€“ this task will now be yours going forward. As Narendra stated, we need to validate the number of null/blank episode numbers and titles between DEV and PROD. 
Next step : Compare ref.tms_all_program in Dev(Full DB file) with Production(Update File) and see if how many records have episode numbers in available in Dev which are missing in Prod. 
values to validate after full load: prgm_episode_number prgm_seriesid epi_title 


Hi Kyle, I have loaded Full DB file in DEV. /product/app_data/AM_SPARK/data/landing/mas_ncs_api/archive/on_tv_programs_v22-db_20210404.xml.gz.20210405203210 

Next step : Compare ref.tms_all_program in Dev(Full DB file) with Production(Update File) and see if how many records have episode numbers in available in Dev which are missing in Prod. Note: I took backup of the loaded data in below HDFS path thinking if the Dev tidal is running any of the tms job /product/app_data/AM_SPARK/datacore/data/ref/tms_all_program/main_null_episode
